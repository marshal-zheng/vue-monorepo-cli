# Vue-Monorepo-Cli

`Vue-Monorepo-Cli` is a monolithic repository (monorepo) project that leverages Lerna, PNPM, Storybook, Vue 2, and Rollup to manage and build Vue.js components and applications.

## Features

- **Lerna** for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
- **PNPM** for efficient and fast package management.
- **Storybook** for building UI components and pages in isolation.
- **Vue 2** for creating compelling user interfaces.
- **Rollup** for efficient bundling of JavaScript files.
- **Interactive CLI** for managing packages and components through a user-friendly command-line interface, supporting actions like create, remove, and rename.
- **Prompt Support**: Seamlessly add, delete, or rename packages and components through an interactive prompt, powered by a Node.js script.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and PNPM installed on your system.

#### Installing Node.js and PNPM

- **Node.js**: Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

## Managing Packages with Lerna and PNPM

This project uses Lerna and PNPM for managing packages in a monorepo setup. Below are some common commands you'll find useful:

### Adding a Dependency


- **To add a dependency to a specific package within the monorepo:**
  ```bash
  pnpm add <package-name> --filter <package-directory>
  ```

- **To add a dependency to all packages in the monorepo:**
  ```bash
  pnpm add -w <package-name>
  ```
  > **Tip:** The `-w` or `--workspace-root` flag adds the package to the root [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fadmin%2FHQ%2Ftdui-new%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/admin/HQ/tdui-new/package.json"), making it available to all packages.

- **To add a development dependency to all packages:**
  ```bash
  pnpm add -w -D <package-name>
  ```
  > **Tip:** The `-D` flag specifies that the package is a development dependency, meaning it will only be used for development purposes and not included in the production build.

- **Clean all node_modules directories:**
  ```bash
  pnpm clean
  ```
  > **Tip:** Removing the [`node_modules`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fadmin%2FHQ%2Ftdui-new%2Fnode_modules%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/admin/HQ/tdui-new/node_modules") directory can help resolve conflicts and issues with dependencies by forcing a fresh install of all packages.

- **Build all packages:**
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```
  > **Tip:** This command runs the build script in every package that has it, in topological order (dependencies are built first).

- **Build a specific package:**
  ```bash
  pnpm build --scope <package-name>
  ```
  > **Tip:** This allows you to build only a specific package and its dependencies.

- **List all packages:**
  ```bash
  pnpm build --scope <package-name>
  ```
  > **Tip:** This allows you to build only a specific package and its dependencies.

### Managing Packages and Components
You can perform operations such as new, delete, and rename a a package or components using the interactive prompt mode, You can perform operations such as adding, deleting, and renaming packages and components using the interactive prompt mode.

```bash
1.pnpm new

2.pnpm delete

3.pnpm rename
```
>**Tip:** Follow the step-by-step guide to create packages and components; **Tip:** Use the interactive prompt to add, delete, or rename packages. The corresponding `package.json` and related keywords will be automatically updated.

You can also migrate existing packages to the `packages` directory using Git clone. 
>**Note:** ðŸŸ¡ Since development and debugging are based on Storybook, which in turn relies on Webpack 5, additional Webpack plugin configurations are necessary for cloned repositories. These configurations should be added to `./storybook/main.ts`.

## Building Documentation Service

To compile the documentation into static files, You can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm build-docs
```

## Important Notice on Builder Support

The `webpack-builder` is currently not supported. You may use `rollup-builder` or configure your own builder settings in the upcoming package release.
